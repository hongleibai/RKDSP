# RKDSP
Data
Data composition: Similarity_Matrix_Drugs.txt in the folder Model/RKDSP/data/drug is the drug-drug similarity matrix based on chemical substructure. drug_drug_sim_dis.txt is the drug-drug similarity matrix based on associated diseases. mat_drug_se .txt is the drug-side effect association matrix. se_se_sim.txt is the side effect similarity matrix. The drug and side effect name files are saved in the Data folder and named drugname.txt and se.txt respectively.

Data sourcesï¼šThe dataset of drug-related side effect associations prediction is extracted from Luo et al [1], containing drug-side effect associations, drug-disease associations, and drug-drug similarities based on chemical substructure. A total of 80,164 pairs of associations involving 708 drugs and 4192 side effects were derived from the SIDER database. The original drug-disease associations are extracted from the Comparative Toxicogenomics database, which covers 199,214 pairs of associations for 708 drugs and 5,603 diseases.

Data preprocessing
We first used RKDSP/Process/drug_se_process.py to construct a drug-side effect heterogeneous graph based on the initial data. The heterogeneous graph is projected by different meta-paths to get semantic subgraphs containing different semantic information. The generated semantic subgraphs were saved in Model/RKDSP/data/drug folder.
Training process
Run Model/RKDSP/src/main.py to load the preprocessed semantic subgraphs and perform training and testing. Model details are saved in the file Model/RKDSP/src/model.py
Results
We applied the trained RKDSP model to obtain the top 30 candidate side effects for each drug. The results were saved as ST3.xls.
